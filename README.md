# Zeta Players

What are the Zeta Players? Zeta Players are nextbots designed to play sandbox. This means I have provided the weapons and tools to allow them to do that so they can do whatever they want. They will teach you on how it FEELS to play sandbox.

After many months in development, it is finally time the Zetas had their own Github. I am burnt out on working on the Zetas so if you want to make your own changes/fixes in seperate forks you are very much free to do so. I do ask if you fix something shoot a pull request here so the workshop addon can have that fix
